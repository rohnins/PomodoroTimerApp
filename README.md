# PomodoroTimerApp

Hey Peeps, this is just a small project to create a small programm that helps you to stay focused and productive.

For that i got influeced by the pomodoro technique and since my phone has no timer functions for the StandbyMode that was introduced in IOS 17, i want to create a desktop App for that.

I hope to finish this sideproject and add more features, maybe new endpoints, AI (jk), nextcloud integration/web-app. Lets see what i can do when i have some idle time during work.
